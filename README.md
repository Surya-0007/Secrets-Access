  <li>It is a mini backend project in which user can access some secrets by filling the correct password</li>
  <li>ExpressJS has been used as a web application framework</li>
  <li>We have touched the concepts of Middleware and used some like body-parser</li>

<h2>Now, What is Middleware ?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Middleware functions are an integral part of an application built with the Express framework</li>
  <li>They access the HTTP request and response objects and can either terminate the HTTP request or forward it for further processing to another middleware function.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What is the function of body-parser middleware ?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Express body-parser is an npm module used to process data sent in an HTTP request body.</li>
  <li>It provides four express middleware for parsing JSON, Text, URL-encoded, and raw data sets over an HTTP request body.</li>
  <li>Before the target controller receives an incoming request, these middleware routines handle it.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
